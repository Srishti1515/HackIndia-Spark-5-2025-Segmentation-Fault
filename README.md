## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Student Registration**  
   - Enter Student ID and Name
   - System captures multiple face images and stores them for training

2. **Train the Model**  
   - After registration, train the recognizer with the saved images

3. **Take Attendance**  
   - Start the attendance process
   - System recognizes faces and marks attendance in a `.csv` file

4. **Check Attendance Record**  
   - View saved attendance reports
